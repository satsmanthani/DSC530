## Data import and cleansing  

### Source dataset

[New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)

### Packages
Import the required packages/libraries to anlayze the dataset  

```{r libraries, message = FALSE}

library(ggplot2)    # plots for visualization
library(dplyr)      # for data manipulation
library(corrplot)   # for display of correlation matrix
library(GGally)     # for gallary display of charts
library(gridExtra)  # to view plots in grid
library(purrr)      # for map_dbl function

```

### Read the data file  

```{r data_import}
airbnb.df  <- read.csv("AB_NYC_2019.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


```

### Understanding the data  

```{r basic_check}

# view its class
class(airbnb.df)

# dimensions of the data
dim(airbnb.df)

# Structure of the dataset
str(airbnb.df)             

```

There are no special characters or spaces in column names, renaming is not required.  
However, some of the categorical variables can be converted to factors. Before conversion, let's check how many unique values are there for each of these variables in the dataset.  

### Unique values of variables  

```{r unique}
#following function gets unique values for each variable in the dataset  
sapply(airbnb.df, function(x) length(unique(x)))
```
From the above output, I can see neighbourhood_group, room_type, neighbourhood variables can be factors


### Data type conversion

```{r data_types}

# convert neighbourhood_group, room_type, neighbourhood to factors
airbnb.df['neighbourhood_group'] <- as.factor(airbnb.df$neighbourhood_group)
airbnb.df['room_type'] <- as.factor(airbnb.df$room_type)
airbnb.df['neighbourhood'] <- as.factor(airbnb.df$neighbourhood)

#Convert last_review to date datatype
airbnb.df['last_review'] <- as.Date(airbnb.df$'last_review')

#Look at the new structure
str(airbnb.df)

```


### Looking at the raw data

```{r head_data}
head(airbnb.df)
```

### Drop unwanted variables  

As we can see there are a couple of id columns namely id, host_id which dont carry much information as far as our analysis is concerned. So I'm removing them from the dataset.  

```{r drop_ids}
drops <- c("id","host_id")
airbnb.df <- airbnb.df[ , !(names(airbnb.df) %in% drops)]
```


Check if there are any **duplicate rows** from the dataset. Duplicate rows can affect the data analysis.    

### Duplicate check

```{r dup_check}
#Number of observations in the file
rows <- nrow(airbnb.df)

#Number of unique rows 
unique_rows <- nrow(unique(airbnb.df))

rows == unique_rows
```

Since the total rows is equal to unique rows, we can see that there are no duplicates in the dataset.  


### Missing values
Check for missing values in the dataset. Missing values can lead to unwanted results, so its good to cleanse such rows.  


```{r missing_values_perc}

sapply(airbnb.df,      # apply to each column of the dataframe 
  function(x)  # this function:
    sum(is.na(x))  # count the NAs
) / nrow(airbnb.df) * 100  # then divide the result by the number of rows in the airbnb dataframe

#summary(airbnb.df)
airbnb.df[is.na(airbnb.df$price)]
```
From the above output, we can see reviews_per_month variable has 20% NA values.  
I'll omit the missing value rows if I find reviews_per_month has significant effect on the price of the hotel.  
For now, I think there's no need to manually treat the data.

## Data Exploration  

### Understand categorical variables    

```{r levels}
#Neighbourhood Groups
levels(airbnb.df$neighbourhood_group)

#Available room types
levels(airbnb.df$room_type)


```

```{r summary}
#Glimpse of Airbnb dataset
glimpse(airbnb.df)
```


----------  

### Distributions  

Let's take a look at the distribution of our target variable "Price"  - 

```{r distr1}
#Distribution of Price variable
ggplot(airbnb.df, aes(x=price)) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = 'blue') + coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,2000)) + theme_classic() + labs(title = 'Histogram of Price', x = 'Price', y = 'Count')

```

It doesn't look like a Normal distribution.  It is heavily skewed to the right.  

### Histogram of Price with LOG transformation

```{r distr2}
#Distribution of Price variable
ggplot(airbnb.df, aes(x=price) ) + geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill = 'blue') + scale_x_log10() + labs(title = 'Histogram of Price', x = 'Price', y = 'Count')

```



```{r hist3}
 ggplot(airbnb.df, aes(x=price) ) + geom_histogram(bins = 30, aes(y = ..density..), fill = "blue") +   geom_density(alpha = 0.2, fill = "blue") + scale_x_log10() + labs(title = 'Histogram of Price(log) by Neighborhood type ', x = 'Price', y = 'Count')+ facet_wrap(~neighbourhood_group) 

```

### Correlation   

I want to check the correlation between Price and Number of reviews, Minimum nights and Availability_365 variables  


```{r corr1}
# Reading numberic variables and checking for correlation
df  <- airbnb.df  %>% select("price","number_of_reviews","minimum_nights", "availability_365")
cor(df)
```

These variables are not highly linearly correlated(values < 0.1) to Price variable.  

```{r price_range}
#Quantiles of price
summary(airbnb.df$price)

```

Median Airbnb rental price is \$106 in NYC and Max price being \$10k.  


### Plots for Price Vs other variables    



```{r room_price}

#Room type vs Price plot
ggplot(airbnb.df, aes(x = room_type, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = room_type)) + scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = 'Price by Room type', x = 'Room type', y = 'Price') + geom_hline(yintercept = mean(airbnb.df$price), color = "purple", linetype = 2)

```

From the above plot, we can see Home/Apt's mean price is higher than other room types.  
So, room type is definitely related to Price variable.  


```{r neighbor_price}
# Neighborhood group vs Price plot
ggplot(airbnb.df, aes(x = neighbourhood_group, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = neighbourhood_group)) + scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = 'Price by Neighborhood Group', x = 'Neighborhood Group', y = 'Price') + geom_hline(yintercept = mean(airbnb.df$price), color = "purple", linetype = 2)

```

From the above plot, we can see Airbnb hotels are expensive in Manhattan and Bronx being the cheapest!  
So, Neighborhood Group has relationship with Price.  



-------  

### Scatter plots  


```{r geography}
#Neighbourhood group with latitude and logitude
ggplot(data = airbnb.df, aes(latitude, longitude, color = neighbourhood_group)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Neighbourhood Groups", x = "Latitude", y = "Longitude")
```

The above map shows the neighbourhood group map and appropriately colors it.  


```{r scatter_plot1}
#Availability vs Price plot
ggplot(airbnb.df, aes(availability_365, price)) + geom_jitter() + labs(title = 'Availability vs Price plot', x = 'Availability 365', y = 'Price')

```

There is no particular linear correlation between Price vs Availability variable alone.  



```{r scatterplot2}
#Number of reviews vs Price plot
ggplot(airbnb.df, aes(number_of_reviews, price)) + geom_jitter() + labs(title = 'Number of reviews vs Price plot', x = 'Number of reviews', y = 'Price')

```



-------  

### Top 10 Prices  

```{r top_10_prices}
##Price values are most occuring in the dataset
top_10 <- airbnb.df  %>%  select(price)  %>% group_by(price)  %>% summarise(count = n())  %>%
arrange(desc(count)) %>% top_n(10)
top_10

```

From the above aggregate counts, the most used Price value in the dataset is 100. So, no wonder the median is 106.  



----------  


## Linear regression  

Let's build model for target variable "Price" with other independent variables  

### Model 1

```{r linear1}
# linear regression model for Price
price_model1 = lm(price ~ latitude + longitude + room_type + minimum_nights  + availability_365 + neighbourhood_group, data = airbnb.df) 
summary(price_model1) #Review the results

```

Linear regression for target variable Price with independent variables latitude, longitude, room_type, minimum_nights , availability_365 and neighbourhood_group.  

Interpretion:  
  1. Except minimum_nights, all other variables are statistically significant. Because p-value is less than 1%.  
  2. R-square is small (9.4%), that means the model doesn't explain the variation to a great extent.
  3. Max Residuals tells us there are outliers in the dataset.  

The model can be viewed visually below.    

```{r lm_plot1}
plot(price_model1)
```

Normal Q-Q plot tells us that the model is not a great fit.  
Outliers causing leverage to be high on certain points.  

So, I want to test the regression with log transformation on the price, since log gave us better correlation earlier.  


### Model 2 - with Log transformation  

```{r linear2}
airbnb.df$log_price <- log(airbnb.df$price + min(airbnb.df$price) + 1)
#training.df$log_price <- log(training.df$price + min(training.df$price) + 1)
#testing.df$log_price <- log(testing.df$price + min(testing.df$price) + 1)


#all(is.na(log(airbnb.df$price)))
# linear regression model for Price
price_model2 = lm(log_price ~ latitude + longitude + room_type + minimum_nights  + availability_365 + neighbourhood_group, data = airbnb.df, na.action=na.exclude) 
summary(price_model2) #Review the results

```

```{r lm_plot2}
plot(price_model2)
```

Normal Q-Q plot tells us this model is a better fit than previous model.  
And there is a great improvement in R-squared value (48% from 8% in the previous model).  
So, I conclude log(price) model is a great fit to the dataset. All variables in the model are statistically significant. Leverage plot tells us there are outliers in the dataset.
